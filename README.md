# Windows 11 Password Bypass Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps to bypass the password for Windows 11 using the command prompt and system utility files. It is intended for **ethical use only** in scenarios where the user has authorization to access the system (e.g., forgotten passwords).

## Steps to Bypass the Windows 11 Password:
1. **Restart the System**: 
   - Hold the **Shift key** while restarting.
   - Navigate to **Troubleshoot** > **Advanced Options** > **Command Prompt**.

2. **Check Windows Directory**:
   - Identify the correct drive (usually `C:` or `D:`).
   - Confirm it contains Windows system files.
   
3. **Access System32**:
   ```bash
   cd Windows/System32
   
4. **Rename Utility Manager**:
   ```bash
   ren utilman.exe utilman1.exe

5. **Replace Utility Manager with CMD**:
   ```bash
   ren cmd.exe utilman.exe

6. **Continue Booting**:
   - Once Windows boots to the login screen, open the Accessibility menu.
   - The Command Prompt should open instead of the utility manager.

7. **Reset Password**:
   - In the CMD window, run:
     ```bash
     control userpasswords2
   - Select the user account and reset the password.


## Restoring Utility Manager:
**After accessing the system, you can restore the utility manager with the following steps:**

1. **Restart in Command Prompt**: 
   - Follow the same steps to access the Command Prompt via the Advanced Options menu.

2. **Restore Utility Manager**:
   ```bash
   cd Windows/System32
   ren utilman.exe cmd.exe
   ren utilman1.exe utilman.exe
